    feat(genesis): create shared understanding from initial spark

    This commit represents the culmination of a collaborative process,
    transforming a high-level vision into a tangible, robust, and
    well-architected plan.

    It moves from a simple, monolithic data structure to a flexible,
    asynchronous, and validated system. The user experience is elevated
    from a static display to a dynamic, animated, and stateful
    editing interface.

    This is not just code; it is a log of resolved bugs, refined
    aesthetics, and the shared "Yatta!" moments of understanding. It's
    the artifact of a conversation.

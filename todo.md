1) fix(edit): fix edit button to load edit form without needing to click on element beforehand
2) fix preview pane repeat 2fr, 1 ending up as 2 columns for grid and 2 for panel container while panel grid only occupies the left and makes it have 3/4 filled and 1/4 empty space
3) add schemas for buildings and technologies and godpowers and gods and abilities and minor gods and major gods
    - add form editor for each
    - add validation for each
    - add whatever else
4) fix all the fkin red man & reorganize the directories if needed
5) [unit/tech/building grid tile, preview panel, minor/major god card to section-size form animation](https://x.com/i/grok?conversation=1938943522117501432)
6) download json button
7) export/share civ button that extracts just the major and minor gods as a nice reddit/twitter post format?
8) massively overhaul form editor experience
    - sliders for numbers with color indicating very underpowered to very overpowerd
    - grid view packing as much information horizontally as possible
    - clustering relevant forms together
    - 
9) restructure json blob to work like the schemas? to follow the "atomic" domain-driven design pattern
10) ASSETS

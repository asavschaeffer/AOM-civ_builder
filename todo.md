1) fix(edit): fix edit button to load edit form without needing to click on element beforehand
2) fix preview pane repeat 2fr, 1 ending up as 2 columns for grid and 2 for panel container while panel grid only occupies the left and makes it have 3/4 filled and 1/4 empty space
3) add schemas for buildings and technologies and godpowers and gods and abilities and minor gods and major gods
4) download json button
5) export/share civ button that extracts just the major and minor gods as a nice reddit/twitter post format?
6) massively overhaul form editor experience
    - sliders for numbers with color indicating very underpowered to very overpowerd
    - grid view packing as much information horizontally as possible
    - clustering relevant forms together
    - 
7) restructure json blob to work like the schemas? to follow the "atomic" domain-driven design pattern
8) ASSETS
    - copy the links from the AoM wiki?
    - pull from game files using that guys tool
    - just use emojis? lol
9) database
10) homepage

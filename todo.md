1) fix(edit): fix edit button to load edit form without needing to click on element beforehand
2) fix preview pane repeat 2fr, 1 ending up as 2 columns for grid and 2 for panel container while panel grid only occupies the left and makes it have 3/4 filled and 1/4 empty space
2.5) review responsive setup, particularly grid and tile views. ideally we have significant margins on the sides at full browser view to maintain the typical reader experienc and make room for ads in the future. the grid tile sizes need to adjust to the vw vh, rather than the grid-cols and grid-rows changing. all that being said we also need to significantly ponder the mobile experience
3) add schemas for buildings and technologies and godpowers and gods and abilities and minor gods and major gods
    - add form editor for each
    - add validation for each
    - add whatever else
4) fix all the fkin red man & reorganize the directories if needed
5) [unit/tech/building grid tile, preview panel, minor/major god card to section-size form animation](https://x.com/i/grok?conversation=1938943522117501432)
6) download json button
7) export/share civ button that extracts just the major and minor gods as a nice reddit/twitter post format?
8) massively overhaul form editor experience
    - sliders for numbers with color indicating very underpowered to very overpowerd
    - grid view packing as much information horizontally as possible
    - clustering relevant forms together
    - 
9) restructure json blob to work like the schemas? to follow the "atomic" domain-driven design pattern
10) ASSETS
    - copy the links from the AoM wiki?
    - pull from game files using that guys tool
    - just use emojis? lol
11) database
12) homepage
13) image uploading for gods and units and buildings and technologies and godpowers and abilities
14) ai image gen from sample gods.. etc images
